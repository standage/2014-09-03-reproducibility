# Reproducibility in Bioinformatics

## Homework: Git and GitHub

Git is a very popular version control system that is used extensively by the bioinformatics and genomics communities.
Git, like all version control systems, was designed for managing software development, but its features are perfectly suited for managing any data-driven science project.
No bioinformatics project is perfect from the start, but taking frequent snapshots of your project's code, data, and documentation--even during the early stages--will pay many dividends in the end.
Paired with an automated workflow, version control is the best way to facilitate reproducibility.

GitHub is a service that provides free hosting of open-source git repositories.
In addition to providing remote backup of your project, GitHub has a lot of useful features that make collaboration on a project very easy.

In this assignment, we'll cover the basics of git and GitHub that you'll need to begin using it right away in your projects.
